# TypeScript React Storybook Starter

This project is a starting template for creating React components with [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook). It was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). React Storybook was added next and lastly TypeScript support.

There is a small sample Random Image component that is placed as an example.

To use this repository, run your JavaScript package manager install cmd `npm install` or `yarn install`. If everything installs successfully you can run either the start task `npm start` or `yarn start`, or the storybook task  `npm run storybook` or `yarn run storybook`. Start and Storybook do the same thing.

Feel free to file an issue if this doesn't work for you. I've only tested it on a very small number of systems (my own).
